What is Syntelligence?

What is a Syntelligence Coach?
You're made of intelligence; you are an emotional being with a conscious intellect, and a physically complex body. Syntelligence Coaching does indeed what its etymology implies, synergizing your intelligence at all levels to free you to live the life that you deserve.​​
A Syntelligence Coach is trained to methodically and scientifically profile an individual to establish their needs, emotional blueprint, and priorities. In doing so, they are equipped to assist others in identifying their distinct personal purpose and values, establish the vision founded upon these values, and construct a plan that is in alignment with such vision/mission to achieve it in full. Syntelligence Coaches are qualified to utilize emotional strategies, techniques and modalities for personal healing, growth and achievement. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e4bbf707-375d-4b50-9f4e-ef9c3abb0558.jpg)
